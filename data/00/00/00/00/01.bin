  |   In war, not everyone is a soldier.                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a     |
  |   group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling   |
  |   with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and      |
  |   hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen       |
  |   from an entirely new angle.                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle.   |
  |   During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge,     |
  |   so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading   |
  |   and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your         |
  |   civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique            |
  |   locations for items that will help you stay alive.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to       |
  |   protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for     |
  |   longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad            |
  |   decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the   |
  |   better.                                                               |
